# Course Description

The Data Analytics General Assembly course was split into three sections: advanced excel, SQL, and Tableu. The files in this repository are all from the SQL section of the course. We used pgAdmin to access the Iowa 
Liquor Sales Database for all in class work and the unit 2 project.
