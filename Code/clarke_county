UNION for counties with growth count: Clarke
The join to the county table didnâ€™t have any effect on the numbers I got
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(sl.store) AS total_stores, Extract(quarter from sl.date)
FROM sales sl
RIGHT JOIN stores st
ON sl.store = st.store
WHERE date >= '2014-01-01'
AND date <='2014-03-31'
AND st.store_status  = 'A'
AND sl.county ILIKE 'clarke'
group by Extract(quarter from date)
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(sl.store) AS total_stores, Extract(quarter from sl.date)

RIGHT JOIN stores st
ON sl.store = st.store
WHERE date >= '2014-04-01'
