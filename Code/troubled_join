Total sales for categories from q1 (ended up running this 4 times changing the date and joined the columns in excel to get all 4 quarters)
WITH q1_data AS (SELECT *
	FROM sales
	WHERE date >= '2014-01-01'
	AND date <='2014-03-31')

SELECT DISTINCT category_name, SUM(total) AS total_sales
FROM q1_data
GROUP BY category_name
ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC
